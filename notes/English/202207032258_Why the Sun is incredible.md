# Vocabulary building

- When the Sun rises or sets in the sky, ==the shortwave colors== green, blue, and [[violet]] ==are [[scatter|scattered]]==, leaving only the yellow and the red part of the [[spectrum]], ==giving that amazing [[glow]]==.

- Even the [[bluish]] light from a mobile phone late at night ==is enough to [[disrupt]] and confuse our internal body clock==.

- Deep in its core, ==at around 15 million degrees Celsius==, the Sun is [[constantly]] fusing hydrogen together to make [[helium]].
