# Vocabulary building

- And while it's generally [[frown|frowned]] [[upon]] and I don't [[condone]] it, peeking at the names of the Great Lakes on a geography test when you're 6 years old doesn't mean you're gonna grow up to be a horrible adult.

- Extra [[testosterone]] gives us the courage to cheat, and extra [[cortisol]] gives us the motivation.

- [[elevate|Elevated]] cortisol, [[meanwhile]], is linked to a state of [[chronic]] stress that can be almost [[debilitating]], so that could be a powerful motivator in deciding to cheat.

# Writting

- My:

If you fapped and undered the huge stress last night, next day, you will make feel debilitating, meanwhile probably couldn't focus on your job.

But benefit is you could make feel like fly in the sky.

- Recommend:

If you fap and were under a lot of stress the night before, you will feel debilitating the next day, and you will most likely be unable to focus on your job.

The advantage is that you can feel like you're flying through the sky.
