# Vocabulary building

- Back in 2003, ==the sleep [[assessment]] and [[advisory]] service in the UK== **broke down** the six basic sleep positions and ==compared them to their personality types==.

- But [[fetal]] is one of six possible sleeping positions: fetal, [[freefall]], starfish, soldier, [[log]] and [[yearner]].

- [[cynicism]] more, ==maybe you're [[suspicious]] or==, you're more friendly or ==even whether you're more [[brash]]== or you're good at taking [[criticism]].

# Writting

- My:

Cynicism means a person who have helpless personality and maybe compound with like brash or suspicious.

Uh..., sounds not bad ?

- Recommend:

Cynicism [[denote|denotes]] a helpless personality, which may be combined with traits such as brashness or suspicion.

Uh... that doesn't sound too bad ?
