- Think about it this way: ==Well==, it is estimated that ==there are millions of [[asteroid|asteroids]] in the asteroid [[belt]]==.

- In Captain America: ==the Winter Soldier==, which is an awesome movie, ==we see cap free-falling without a [[parachute]]== and landing in the water. ==[[Seemingly]] [[unscathed]]==.

- If you try to do this with just a normal gun, ==it won't work== because the bullet does not provide enough of the spark to [[ignite]] the [[gasoline]].
