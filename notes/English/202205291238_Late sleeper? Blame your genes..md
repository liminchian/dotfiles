# Writting

- My:

==NBA game in the Western final is Warriors versus Mavericks throughout== not Currey's individual show.

==Maybe is quirky==, but I think this was ==best status of Golden Warriors==.

- Recommend:

==Throughout the Western finals, the NBA game is Warriors vs. Mavericks==, not Currey's individual show.

==Perhaps eccentric==, but I believe this was ==Golden Warriors' best status==.
