# Vocabulary building

- And now however [[illogical]] it sounds, ==it doesn't quite feel right unless== it's kind of [[awful]] as well. ==It's not nice as such but it feels comfortingly [[compelling|compellingly]] familiar==.

- [[Humiliating]] them in turn, ==[[bossing]] them about==, going cold on th==em, just when they're [[vulnerable]] to us==.

- Now sadly, ==anyone who's warm and [[cuddly]] is imagined to be [[punitive]] around sex==, and [[hence]] feels wrong and ==has to be rejected our inner love maps== are really hard to [[tease]] out.
