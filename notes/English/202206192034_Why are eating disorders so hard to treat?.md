# Vocabulary building

- Eating disorders are a range of [[psychiatric]] conditions ==characterized by these main patterns of behavior==:[[restrict|Restricting]] food [[intake]], ==[[binge|bingeing]] or rapidly consuming large amounts of food==, and [[purge|purging]] or [[eliminating]] calories through [[vomit|vomiting]], ==[[laxative|laxatives]]==, [[excessive]] exercise, ==and other harmful means==.

- For example, ==people living with [[anorexia]] usually restrict the amount of food they eat==, while [[bulimia nervosa]] is an eating disorder ==[[characterize|characterized]] by [[recurrent]] binges and purges==.

- That's because eating disorders are, at their core, psychiatric [[illness|illnesses]].
