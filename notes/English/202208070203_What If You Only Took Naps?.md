# Vocabulary building

- Generally, sleep [[deprivation]] can make you [[irritable]], slow your reaction time, increase anxiety, and even affect your ability to form memories.

- In the late 80's, a [[neurologist]] and sleep expert named Claudio Stampi studied the effects of polyphasic sleep schedules on [[yachtsmen]] racing across the Atlantic ocean.

- While a longer nap lasting 30 minutes to an hour will get you into the deeper sleeping stages, leaving you with a feeling of [[sluggishness]] when you wake up.
