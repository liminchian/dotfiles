# Vocabulary building

- **[[ostensibly|Ostensibly]]**, ==we **all** want love==, but **oddly**, ==one of the **hardest** things to do== is not hold it **against** people ==when they **do** actually turn around== and **[[reciprocate]]** our feelings.

- It can be **[[immensely]]** hard ==not to think that those who **offer** us love== are in some ways ==weak==, mistaken, ==needy==, [[craven]], ==or just [[defective]]==.

- And our **primary** [[preoccupation]] ==was a [[thrilling]] **[[dread]]**== that the [[admired]] person ==hadn't even noticed us==.
