# Vocabulary building

- I've got some **tips** for you on ==how to **[[declutter]]** your life==.

- If the answer is **yes**, ==well [[obviously]] you can keep it==; and if the answer is **no,** ==the next question might be==: Well, am I keeping it for **[[sentimental]]** value?

- I mean **of course** ==it's okay to buy things that you want, that you don't necessarily need, ==but just [[prioritize]] them, ==and choose those things that you really **really want**==, instead of those things that you just kind of want.

# Writting

- My:

People say Taiwanese was a sentimental person, obviously the priority sit empty all the time was the situation to show.
But sometimes need prioritize between healthy and psychological factors.

- Recommend:

People say Taiwanese are **sentimental**; ==obviously==, the priority sit empty all the time was the situation to show.
==However==, it is sometimes necessary to **prioritize** individual health and psychological factors.
