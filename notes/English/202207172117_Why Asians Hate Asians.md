# Vocabulary building

- I've been having a lot of conversations this past year, ==especially during Stop Asian Hate== about the [[nuance|nuanced]] [[hierarchy]] within Asian communities that keep us [[divid|divided]], ==and on a personal level==, I've experienced this social [[disparity]] myself.

- You only identify with your Japanese side because it's [[trendy]].

- Can you do it with an Asian [[accent]]?

# Writting

- My:

The trendy people must have accent, and disparity everything like shoes, gloves even though you mouth.

I have no idea about that behaviors.

- Recommend:

The trendy people must have an accent and contrast everything, including shoes, gloves, and even your mouth.

I'm not familiar with those behaviors.
