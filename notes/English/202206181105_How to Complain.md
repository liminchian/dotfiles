# Vocabulary building

- Almost everyday, ==with [[slightly]] [[dispirite|dispiriting]] [[inevitability]]==, someone in our [[vicinity]] ==will hurt us in some way==.

- They'll be [[neglectful]] of something that matters [[immensely]] to us. ==They'll be, to a greater or lesser [[extent]]==, unkind, ==[[thoughtless]]==, [[offensive]] or [[brusque]].

- And yet, ==our style of reacting to [[maltreatment]]== goes right to the heart of who we are ==and can make the difference between a life of constant [[frustration]] and [[bitterness]]== and one of [[tolerable]] [[coexistence]].

# Writting

- My:

I hate when I wake up and the couldn't neglectful voice: "Go back to the bed! And sleep until you fill energy." with the bad smell was coexistence, so I use an application that will prompt one story everyday let my wake up time be more funny.

- Recommend:

I despise waking up to the couldn't neglectful voice: "Return to your bed!
And sleep until your energy reserves are depleted."
With the bad smell was coexistence, so I use an app that will prompt one story every day to make my wake-up time more entertaining.
