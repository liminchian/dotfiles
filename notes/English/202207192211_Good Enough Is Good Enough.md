# Vocabulary building

- Winnicottâ€™s [[crucial]] insight was that the parentsâ€™ [[agony]] was coming from a particular place: [[excessive]] hope.

- Their [[despair]] was a [[consequence|consequences]] of a [[cruel]] and [[counterproductive]] perfectionism.

- No child, he [[insist|insisted]], needs an ideal parent; they just need an okay, pretty [[decent]], usually well [[intentioned]], sometimes a bit [[grumpy]] but basically reasonable father or mother.

# Writting

- My:

In a perfectionism's world, It's not "enough good" exists, but human was not a robot overtrainning could be counterproductive of consequences. In the same way, over working could let you become grumpy.
So, insisted don't bring work at the home, and the agony could disappear.

- Recommend:

In a perfectionism's world, "enough good" did not exist, but humans were not robots, and overtraining could have negative consequences.
Similarly, overworking can cause you to become grumpy.

So, if you insist on not bringing work home, the agony may disappear.
