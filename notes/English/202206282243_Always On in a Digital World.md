# Vocabulary building

- While modern life [[demand|demands]] some screen usage, ==it's key to balance that usage with habits== that keep you healthy ==and prevent the [[spread]] of [[misinformation]]==.

- Since these devices are almost everywhere, ==instant [[gratification]] is easier than ever==, especially with our phones always close by.

- The ability to escape into a screen at a moment's notice ==can become a [[distraction]] during work==, school, ==and social time==.
