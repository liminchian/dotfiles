# Vocabulary building

- But **now** new research ==published in the journal **Social Psychological** and **Personality Science**== ==found that people who swear **more**== are associated with **higher** levels of **[[honesty]]** and **[[integrity]]!**

- Since swearing is a form of self-expression, ==the researchers say==, "those who do it **more** ==are [[portraying]] themselves== more **honestly** ==than those who **[[refrain|refrains]]**==."

- For example, ==in criminal cases==, innocent [[suspect|suspects]] were more likely to **[[curse]]** ==than guilty suspects when **denying** [[accusation|accusations]]==!
