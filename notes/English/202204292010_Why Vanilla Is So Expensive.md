# Writting

- My:

Deforeastation is a labor-intensive job, and the vanilla ==pollinating== is a labor-instensive job too.

Why they can't just work together?
What's a stupid question!

- Recommend:

Deforestation is a ==time-consuming process==, and vanilla ==pollination== is also time-consuming.

Why can't they just work together?
What a silly question!
