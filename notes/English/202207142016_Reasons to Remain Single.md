# Vocabulary building

- Anyone who lives alone and [[manifest|manifests]] ==no longing to be in a relationship==, is in our times, ==almost automatically==, more or less secretly, ==viewed as both [[pitiable]]== and deeply troubled.

- This sets us up for [[collective]] [[catastrophe]] ==because it means that== a huge number of peopleâ€”==who have no [[innate]] wish to live with anyone else==,

- Only once [[singlehood]] has completely equaled [[prestige]] with its alternative, ==can we ensure that people will be free in their choices== and [[hence]] join couples for the right reasons;

I'm going to go insane!
